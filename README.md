## Game Time

#### This is the module 4 project Game Time.

The project spec is [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown).

Normally the project is done in JavaScript, however we decided to take on the extra challenge of writing the game in Java.  We did this to better challenge our understanding of programming in general, not to just test our knowledge in a certain language.

We're using only native Java libraries, the primary one being Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit).

#### To Run

* clone the project: `$ git clone git@github.com:jdliss/game-time.git`

* move into the `game-time` folder: `$ cd game-time`

* run the `.jar` file: `$ open game.jar`
